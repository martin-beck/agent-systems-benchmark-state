Run a maintained MIT OpenHands SDK or canonical headless client.

Implementation has not started. Read the linked plan before claiming.


- 2026-09-08T03:49:45+00:00: Verified AR-0101, AR-0102 and AR-0103 are durably done. Selected
  highest-priority safe disjoint leaf after P1 authorization/dependency/path blockers; OpenHands
  module and fixtures do not overlap active frontend protocol, verifier integrity, or kernel
  diagnostics paths.
