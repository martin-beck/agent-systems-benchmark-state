## AR-0103

Isolate untrusted generated code and allocate cgroup/CPU/memory/PID budgets.

Implementation has not started. Read the linked plan before claiming.

- 2026-09-06T17:46:58+00:00: Reconciled signed promotion repair d763c7f and fresh state, then
  claimed AR-0103 in its declared feature/sandbox-runtime worktree at exact integrated main e6a81e8.
  The earlier f166248 promotion effect is preserved and its generated-view repair is durable. Native
  probe found bubblewrap 0.9.0 and a working systemd 255 user scope with cgroup v2 controllers,
  while direct current-session cgroup writes and plain unshare user/network are unavailable. A real
  disposable MemoryMax/TasksMax/CPUQuota user scope succeeded. Design will therefore fail closed
  around exact executable/version probes, bubblewrap namespaces with network denial and minimal
  mounts, systemd user-scope resource properties, explicit CPU reservation leases disjoint from CI
  resources, bounded inputs, and documented cgroup/daemonization/platform limits. No root Cargo/lock
  mutation.
