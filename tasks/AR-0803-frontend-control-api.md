## AR-0803

Expose runner planning, launch, status, cancellation, history, and analysis through a stable frontend boundary.

The benchmark runner remains independently operable when no frontend is present or when a frontend crashes.

Implementation has not started. Read the linked plan before claiming.

- 2026-09-07T02:56:13+00:00: Dependencies AR-0101, AR-0104, AR-0204 and AR-0801 are durably done;
  AR-0801 exact-main b2833ab CI and post-merge verification are green. Promote the highest-priority
  compatible frontend control boundary after releasing its Cargo/scheduler fences.
