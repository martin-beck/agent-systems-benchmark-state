Successor created from the exact hosted coverage failure on synchronized
PR #345. It must add real behavioral coverage or prove instrumentation drift;
the coverage floor remains unchanged.

- 2026-09-27T05:08:00+00:00: Created after job 108554587959 reported 89.88%
  coverage at exact synchronized head `c21d1ce5`, below the required 90%.

- 2026-09-27T05:07:41+00:00: Dependencies AR-1200, AR-1379, and AR-1472 are done; promote the
  exact-head authority-resolver coverage successor.

- 2026-09-27T05:07:54+00:00: Claimed by ar1332-record-replay-luna56.
