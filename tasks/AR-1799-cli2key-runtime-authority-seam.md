AR-1797 established that the existing CLI cannot compose the runtime-owned
`Cli2KeySidecar` with the opaque `LiveProviderAttempt`: the sidecar keeps the
invocation key private while the runtime factory constructors are intentionally
not public. Add the narrow authority-boundary seam needed to resolve only the
verified AR-1779 receipt, supervise one sidecar per run or bounded sweep, and
issue an opaque live attempt to the Codex adapter.

- 2026-10-12T02:07:38+00:00: Claimed by codex-ar1799-authority-luna56.

- 2026-10-12T02:07:46+00:00: Claimed after removing blocked AR-1797 from dependency list; AR-1797
  remains the blocked consumer integration task and retains successor evidence.

- 2026-10-12T04:10:16+00:00: Legacy claim owner has no live worker process. Releasing for
  reassignment; prior lease heartbeat and historical evidence preserved.
