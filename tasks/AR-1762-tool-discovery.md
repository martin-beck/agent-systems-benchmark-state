Add a discovery command/API that scans configured project roots and system PATH
locations for known agents, harnesses, benchmarks, workloads, and support tools,
then merges them with project records. Report canonical path, kind, version,
capabilities, digest/availability, and a reason when unavailable. Discovery
must be deterministic, bounded, symlink/path safe, and must not overwrite the
configuration authority; live probes are allowlisted and warning-only when
development authentication/signatures/keys are absent.

- 2026-10-09T15:44:49+00:00: Failure recorded: focused cargo test exited 101 because discovery had
  unused imports, DiscoverySource lacked Ord for deterministic sorting, and tool_discovery passed
  u64 where read_bounded_json requires usize. Patched all four issues; retry through handoffctl.
