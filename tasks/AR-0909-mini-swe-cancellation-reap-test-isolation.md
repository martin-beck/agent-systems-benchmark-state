## AR-0909

Repair the test-isolation and lifecycle oracle exposed by PR #126 Repository Quality run
34406581994. Under the exact coverage command,
`mini_swe::tests::cancellation_reaps_owned_descendant_group` completed cancellation but observed
the captured `/proc/<pid>` entry after its bounded poll and failed at `mini_swe.rs:1859`; the same
unrelated product range passed ordinary Rust, native, emulated-AArch64 and fault workflows.

No existing AR owns this exact embedded-test defect. AR-0308 and AR-0513 are complete adapter and
replay qualifications; AR-0902 is complete general fault assurance. Preserve the failure as a
coverage-context lifecycle/isolation signal until the exact process identity and state are
classified.

- 2026-09-09T21:57:42+00:00: Dependency audit confirms AR-0101, AR-0102, AR-0103, AR-0308 and
  AR-0902 are durably done. No existing AR owns the exact PR #126 cargo-llvm-cov failure in
  mini_swe::tests::cancellation_reaps_owned_descendant_group. Promote as a focused unclaimed
  embedded-test repair; do not weaken production lifecycle semantics.
