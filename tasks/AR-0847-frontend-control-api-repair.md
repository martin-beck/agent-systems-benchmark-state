## AR-0847

Repair the blocked AR-0803 candidate without mutating its dirty worktree in place. Wire the protocol into a real runner endpoint/client and lifecycle recovery path; enforce absolute operation deadlines; restrict negotiation to offered versions; validate the initial envelope through the common path; and enforce bounded privacy for backend responses/errors. Add focused positive and negative tests, formal/fault/privacy evidence, exact immutable review, exact-head CI, integration, and post-merge verification. On completion, reconcile AR-0803's umbrella status and unblock its child frontend ARs.

- 2026-09-07T21:11:02+00:00: Promote focused repair for AR-0803 immutable-review findings;
  dependencies are complete and isolated worktree is available.
