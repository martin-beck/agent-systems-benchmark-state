## AR-0319

Implement the separately specified file-descriptor and helper credential boundaries. AR-0318 intentionally supports environment references only and rejects these sources fail-closed.

Implementation has not started. Read the linked plan before claiming.

- 2026-09-08T14:06:44+00:00: Dependency AR-0318 is durably done for environment-only scope; assign
  FD/helper follow-up to an available worker under its separate contract.

- 2026-09-08T14:06:47+00:00: Claimed by quality_20260906.
