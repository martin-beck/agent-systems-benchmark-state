## AR-0319

Implement the separately specified file-descriptor and helper credential boundaries. AR-0318 intentionally supports environment references only and rejects these sources fail-closed.

Implementation has not started. Read the linked plan before claiming.

- 2026-09-08T14:06:44+00:00: Dependency AR-0318 is durably done for environment-only scope; assign
  FD/helper follow-up to an available worker under its separate contract.

- 2026-09-08T14:08:30+00:00: No worktree, heartbeat, command, or implementation appeared after
  repeated follow-ups; release the idle claim without losing any durable work. Reclaim when a worker
  can begin the declared FD/helper contract.

- 2026-09-08T15:08:17+00:00: Coordinator recovery after repeated live checks: lease remained valid
  but no worker process, heartbeat, checkpoint, or worktree change; no product mutation observed.
  Reopened for safe reassignment.
