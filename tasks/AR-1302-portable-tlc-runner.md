## AR-1302

Provision the clean, portable-containment runner required to unblock AR-1293. Keep all images,
VMs, caches, queues, locks and evidence under `/srv/data/projects`; use immutable provenance,
offline-after-install behavior, no network or host-mount access, bounded execution and sanitized
evidence. Native ARM64 is optional and must not be a gate. Do not modify ASB product code,
asb-tui, handoffctl, or unrelated root-owned admission locks.

- 2026-09-17T07:09:22+00:00: Create clean portable TLC runner to unblock AR-1293; no product or
  asb-tui dependency
