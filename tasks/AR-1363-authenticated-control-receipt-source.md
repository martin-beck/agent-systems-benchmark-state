Successor for blocked AR-1361, explicitly depending on completed AR-1362.
Do not touch asb-tui, reopen stale dependencies, or synthesize authority in CLI.

- 2026-09-24T00:00:00+00:00: Created after AR-1362 delivered the durable
  digest-only runtime authority enrollment contract and all post-merge gates.

- 2026-09-23T23:28:50+00:00: Promote receipt source after AR-1362 completed durable authority
  enrollment and all post-merge gates.

- 2026-09-23T23:29:48+00:00: Blocked after exact protected-main audit at e9d4d3d1: ControlBackend
  AuthRecord still contains only provider/endpoint/credential digests, generation, and status. No
  authenticated certificate chain or runtime-owned authority issuer is available to issue
  RuntimeEnrollmentReceiptV1; synthesizing chain or target/tool/lease/relay authority would violate
  fail-closed policy. Create a successor for authenticated certificate-chain
  enrollment/materialization, then resume AR-1363 and downstream AR-1360.

## Current development and CI qualification boundary

The mandatory development and CI qualification path for this AR is a deterministic
local provider/LLM mock (LiteLLM-compatible where practical), including hostile
negative tests and offline replay where applicable. External/live OpenRouter or
other provider reachability is optional supplementary evidence only; it is never a
completion, dependency-readiness, or CI gate. Production egress policy, credential
non-disclosure, runtime-owned authority, namespace/relay attestation, cancellation
and teardown, and fail-closed denial of unapproved external traffic remain required
contracts. Existing live-provider dependency edges describe production integration
ordering only and must not be used to block local qualification or to claim external
reachability.

- 2026-09-27T00:55:24+00:00: AR-1471 now provides authenticated control-to-runtime chain binding;
  resume downstream receipt-source integration without caller authority.
