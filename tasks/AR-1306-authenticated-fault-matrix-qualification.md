## AR-1306

Implement the narrowly scoped ASB follow-on required by the independent review of PR #221 and
blocked AR-1301. The current fault helper does not prove a real `StrictReplayService`/relay
listener, positive authenticated identity/response parity, or cause-specific provider and
descendant egress denial. This AR owns those missing executable fixtures and their approved KVM
qualification evidence.

AR-1301 is the review predecessor, while AR-1300 and AR-1287 are hard runtime dependencies. The
predecessor is deliberately recorded in this task's scope rather than as a hard dependency to avoid
an impossible AR-1301 -> AR-1306 -> AR-1301 cycle. ASB only: do not change asb-tui, handoffctl,
credentials, live providers, or unrelated coordinator implementation.

Completion requires a real runtime-owned service/listener positive path, exact authenticated
cassette identity and response parity, distinct provider/descendant egress-denial causes, all
remaining lifecycle faults, bounded cleanup, sanitized provenance-bound evidence, signed+DCO
publication, independent review, green exact-head CI, protected merge and post-merge verification.
