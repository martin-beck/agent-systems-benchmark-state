Narrow successor created from AR-1470’s protected-main audit. The predecessor
remains blocked because no control-owned chain population path exists; this AR
must provide that path or leave equally precise evidence without fabricating
authority.

- 2026-09-27T00:12:19+00:00: Dependencies AR-1357, AR-1359 and AR-1362 are done; promote the narrow
  control-to-runtime chain-binding successor from AR-1470 evidence.
