AR-1507 proved that the existing bootstrap contract authenticates only digest
claims and that `RuntimeControlBootstrap::materialize_provisioner` still takes
caller-supplied `RuntimeAuthorityInputs`. This AR owns the missing platform
authority-provider boundary; it must produce verified private material without
exposing it to CLI callers or synthesizing it from fixed paths.

Acceptance requires:

- a runtime/control-owned authority provider authenticated to the AR-1505
  bootstrap session, with verified source/digest binding for namespace, lease,
  relay, tool pins, policy, credential reference, and enrollment material;
- a private materialization API consumed by `RuntimeControlBootstrap` and the
  live scheduler, with no caller/config/socket/path/PATH/fixed-root injection;
- fail-closed behavior for missing, stale, mismatched, expired, revoked,
  restarted, cancelled, or tampered authority, plus alternate-egress denial;
- provider-free deterministic local/mock/replay tests that qualify the contract
  without pretending to be first-customer production evidence;
- independent review, SSH-signed DCO, exact-head hosted checks, protected merge,
  and post-merge assurance.

Non-goals: asb-tui, live provider reachability, public credentials, synthetic or
fixed-path authority, weakening formal/privacy/native gates.

- 2026-09-29T04:14:00+02:00: Created from AR-1507 blocker evidence. The required
  source must be platform-owned and verified; no fixed path or mock authority is
  acceptable in production code.

- 2026-09-29T02:15:14+00:00: Dependencies through AR-1505 verified done; AR-1507 established the
  missing platform-owned authority provider contract.

- 2026-09-29T02:17:57+00:00: Claimed by ar1508_provider_luna56.

- 2026-09-29T02:18:11+00:00: Heartbeat by ar1508_provider_luna56.

- 2026-09-29T02:18:21+00:00: Setup audit: state reconciled and live doctor prerequisites refreshed;
  task revision 2 promoted/open then claimed at revision 3; dependencies include AR-1505 and are
  recorded done; AR-1505 product worktree inspected for requested merge base f92c2e9. Product docs
  and plan inspection now underway.
